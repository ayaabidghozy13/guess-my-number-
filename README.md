# Guess My Number ðŸŽ¯

## Overview
**Guess My Number** is a simple web-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and keeps track of the player's score. 

This project demonstrates how to use the **Document Object Model (DOM)** to interact with and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation:** A new random number is generated every time the game resets.
- **Score Tracking:** The playerâ€™s score decreases with each wrong guess.
- **Highscore:** The game keeps track of the highest score achieved.
- **Responsive Feedback:** Visual and textual feedback is given based on the player's guess.
- **Reset Functionality:** The game can be reset at any time, generating a new random number.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

## How It Works
1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20.
2. The player enters their guess in the input field and clicks "Reveal My Genius!".
3. The game checks if the guess is correct:
   - If correct, the background changes, and the player wins.
   - If incorrect, the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.
4. The score decreases with each incorrect guess.
5. The player can reset the game using the "Reset My Brilliance!" button.

## How to Play
- Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field.
- Click "Reveal My Genius!" to check your guess.
- Try to get the correct number with the highest possible score!

## Future Enhancements
- **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce levels with varying ranges of numbers.
- **Leaderboard:** Implement a global leaderboard to track high scores.
